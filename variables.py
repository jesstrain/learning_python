# To define a variable in Python, use a variable name = and insert a value inside. 
# In this case we have used the variable first_name. This value is a string
# therefore we have inserted speech marks.
# If we want to use mulitple words to define a variable then we separate these with an underscore _. 
# It is always good practice to name variables that reflect what values will be stored inside them and 
# to keep them all in lowercase as Python is a case-sensitive language.
 
first_name = 'Jessica'

# If we want to print the value of a variable, we can use the print() function. 

print(first_name)

# To combine multiple variables and print them out together

first_name = 'Jessica'
last_name = 'Train'

# we then use the + symbol to concatonate (piece together) the values.
# We have used speech marks ' ' so we can space out the sentence. 

print('Your name is ' + first_name + ' ' + last_name)
